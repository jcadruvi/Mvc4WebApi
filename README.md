Mvc4WebApi
==========

This is a test project that I used to learn more about Web API. This project intially shows a list of stores. The user can filter the stores by typing in the search fields on the header of the grid. The filter is triggered by leaving focus or pressing enter.

Need to finish the filter of store search.

The project has the following fetures:
 
Talk about it from a web api point of view. Teach them web api:
	Show action filter.
	Data Annotations
	Ninject.
 
Talk about grid:
	Click on row diplays detail.
		tlk abou the call.
	Filter rows on enter or lose focus.
		Need to use knockout.

Calls:
	Select stores
	Select store
	Select dropdown
	save store
	delete store
