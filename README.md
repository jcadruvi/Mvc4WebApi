Mvc4WebApi
==========

This is a project that I used to learn more about Web API. This project intially shows a list of stores. The user can filter the stores by entering values in the search fields on the header of the grid. The filter is triggered by leaving focus or pressing enter. If the user clicks on row on the grid the detail section will be displayed. The detail section will allow the user to save or delete the store. All saves or deletes are  made to a singleton repository and they will only persist while the user is on the page.

This project contains one MVC call which 

Need to finish the filter of store search.
